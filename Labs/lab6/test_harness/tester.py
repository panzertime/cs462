# create multiple sensors
# delete at least one sensor
# you'll have to reprogram the Wovyn sensor to send events to the new pico instead of the one you created manually. 
#   (Maybe this means print out the ECI, wait, and continue once the Wovyn is connected?)
# tests the sensors by ensuring they respond correctly to new temperature events. 
# tests the sensor profile to ensure it's getting set reliably.
