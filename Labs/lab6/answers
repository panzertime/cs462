1. I listed the rids of the rulesets as attributes of the wrangler/child_creation event I raised.

2. I only send the profile update after recieving the wrangler/child_initialized event. This prevents the child from getting a sensor/profile_udpated event before it is ready.

3. I used Python to send HTTP requests to the pico-engine host. I have my picos send back directives with the eci of newly-created picos, so it's fairly straightforward to "wrangle" them in that way.

4. I would need to create subscriptions with channels between each pair of picos that needs to communicate.
